This project generates an animation and a static graph that illustrate how the **energy of a body with mass increases dramatically** as its speed approaches the speed of light — according to Einstein's theory of relativity.

In addition, the graph shows the **effect of time dilation**, which causes time to slow down for objects moving at extremely high speeds.

## Visualization

### Static Graph (Dark Theme)

![Relativity Graph](grafico_estatico_relatividade.png)

- **Cyan line**: Relative Energy (E/mc²)  
- **Dashed magenta line**: Time dilation (Δt/Δt₀)

---

## Animation

The script also generates a GIF called `grafico_relatividade_duplo.gif` showing the curve growing in real time.

---

##  How to run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alissonKr/grafico_relatividade.git
cd grafico_relatividade
